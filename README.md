# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single page scheduling act made with React, PostgreSQL, Cypress, Jest, and SASS. I learned a ton while working through this project.

I tried to make the code fairly modularized. A stretch goal of mine would be to modularize it further. I was unable to complete any stretch activities for this project, so I hope that you enjoy the bare-bones app!
